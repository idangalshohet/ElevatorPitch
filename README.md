# ElevatorPitch

Hello, this is the github page for elevator pitch, an AXD project that allows 
to create soundscape based off IMU and infrared sensor readings based in the lift.

The following repository shows the final code: Elevator_pitch.py

as well as other codes to show our milestones.


Enjoy!
